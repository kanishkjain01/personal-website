    <h2>What is the purpose of the internet?</h2>
    <h3>10/6/24</h3>
    <p>
        As a 'Zoomer', I don't remember a time without internet. It just was always there. 
        I decided I wanted to be more mindful about the technology and figure out what its true purpose should be. 
        Initially, I thought the internet allows me to network with people and to learn new things. This is true, but 
        this answer led me to further questions: why do I need the internet in particular to network with people and why can't I just go to the local library to learn things? 
        Further, I have done my fair share of doom scrolling on social media - and I am not sure if I was doing anything worthwhile there. 
        Is there a more satisfying answer about the purpose of the internet? 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the the purpose of the internet is to help you solve a certain class of problems with the most convenience and leverage, without permission. 
        This class of problems has to do with learning or sharing information, two fundamental human activities. Obviously, I 
        don't think about this consciously whenever I use the internet. We just innately seem to want to learn and share information, and 
        it makes sense that we would gravitate towards the most convenient methods to do so. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, in the past, if I wanted to explore a new topic, I would have had to go to centralized institutions such as universities and libraries. Today I can use Youtube, OpenCourseWare, and ChatGPT. 
        If I wanted to spread ideas, I would have had to use the printing press or give a speech to a live audience. Today I can write blog posts and record podcasts that can reach anyone on the world.
        If I wanted to know what current events were going on, I would have had to rely on news or word of mouth, Today, I can use X (twitter).  
        If I wanted to sell something, I would have had to go to a public market and find a physical place to set up shop. Today, I can market organically on social media and sell on Etsy and Amazon. 
        If I wanted to find a date or find friends, I would have had to physically go out. Today, I have dating apps and social media. Arguably, this has been a net negative for society, but that is another blog post.
        In all these examples, our motivation is the same as the past: to learn or to share. Even in the dating app example, you are sharing to others that you want a mate. 
        The convenience and permissionless nature is what makes internet preferable over the past alternatives.
        There is also massive leverage because whatever I put out on the internet can reach everyone in the world at any time of the day. My work is out there 'grinding' for me, even when I am sleeping. 
    </p>
    <h4>Okay, the internet is convenient, provides leverage, and is permissionless to use. What are the drawbacks?</h4>
    <p>
        As I have experienced first hand in my life, the internet can also be an addicting drug. It has infinite variation and it can overwhelm your brain. 
        It can put you in a loop that is hard to get out of. Clickbait News, Social Media, Pornography, TV Shows - this stuff can and does hook you. 
        This has the effect of dulling your life satisfaction in the real world and I think should be avoided. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So the internet seems like a double edged sword. How should one navigate it? I think to some extent you have to get addicted and experience the negative aspects of it first hand before 
        you can develep a relationship with it that works for you. In fact, that may be the only way. 
        I learned that it helps to consume content from people that your gut tells you are genuine. On Twitter, there are a lot of high quality people that you can interact with. 
        I think it's important to be self-aware about your own usage. 
        It also makes sense to share only your genuine and truthful self. 
        I think is undeniable that internet makes life easier, and shouldn't be cut out completely.
        There are genuine people on it that out of their own conviction want to help others. 
        Naval Ravikant and Gary Vaynerchuck are two good examples of this. Consuming their content has changed the software in my brain to become a more positive sum thinker. 
        I may never have developed this mindset if it wasn't for the internet allowing me to 'meet' Gary and Naval.

        I think it is important to mention that the internet is not necessary. You don't have to use the internet. 
        The world will still go on with or without you being plugged in. 
        For me, writing this is fun, even if no one will end up reading it. 
        Seeing SpaceX's successful Starship launches is fun. Learning from other people is fun. 
        This is because learning and sharing new things is fun. That is why I will stay connected.
