    <h2>What is Mathematics?</h2>
    <h3>10/23/24</h3>

        We all have an idea of what math is. It's the manipulation of numbers. This blog post 
        attempts to break down into first principles what mathematics is to hopefully build 
        an appreciation for the subject.

        What is a number? A number is an abstract entity. 'Abstract' becuase a number doesn't exist physically - 
        a number is an idea. They are 'entities' because numbers are useful things and have all these cool properties. 
        Numbers can relate to physical things - for example the number 2 can represent 2 
        apples. But, all relations like this are imperfect because as far as we know there is no two identical apples
        (or anything) in the world. A number can represent two theoretically perfect apples, but numbers can also be standalone. 
        They don't need to represent amounts. Using terminology from before, numbers are 
        abstract entities that you can do cool manipulations with.

        There are different ways to note numbers. One way is decimal system. Other ways are tally marks. Compters use binary. 
        But all these notations do the same thing, they keep track of these abstract entities. There are symbols in mathematics, 
        but these symbols are merely ways to manipulate or repsresent numbers. The + sign tells you to 'add' numbers or the 
        variable x indicates that x represents a numner.

        In mathematics, there is a process known as a proof. A proof is a method to determine if a statement regarding numbers is true. 
        An example of a proof is known as 'induction.' As David Deutsch says in the Fabic of Reality.

        There seems to be a misconception that mathematical knowledge is 'infallible.' Like 2 + 2 = 4.
