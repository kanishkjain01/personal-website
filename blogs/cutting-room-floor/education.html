       What should school be? Non-existant. What would happen if I choose to focus on one thing and 
       kept killing it out there. School is a way to make people fucked up.

        School is a glorified day care so that parents can go about and do their things. 
        School is a way to oversocialize, it destroys potential. It beings great kids down and bad kids up.

        Why is it important to understand how everythings works. Because knowledge is power. What is mathematics?
        Operating Systems is such a nice topic to know. How the brain compartmentalizes things.
