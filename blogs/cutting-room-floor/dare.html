    <h2>Dare to Dare</h2>
    <h3>10/31/24</h3>
    <p>
        I envision a world where we are immortal if we want to be. 
        There are no accidental deaths and if you do die, you can be “reconstructed” based off of your latest back-up file.
        We are constantly leveling up our understanding of the fabric of reality and maybe even have figured it all out. 
        We are alchemists and can turn any atom into any other atom. We can harness the energy of the universe. 
        All work is automated and we are retired from birth. We can travel on Mars and beyond. 
        If it turns out that this life is boring, then we will have the ability to transfer ourselves into simulation video 
        games that are much more exciting. Human Beings will have once again turned into artists and romantics. We will dare to love and to be 
        vulnerable and we have even hacked our bodies to make love feel even better than it does today. 
        We will not tied down to any location and can move and live wherever we want.
