# Welcome to My Website 

Hey, my name is Kanishk and I am a builder and engineer at heart with additional interests in health and photography.

I think that it is important to have a personal brand on the internet because it allows you to connect with the world 
and offer your help to people who you would not be able to in a less connected world. 

The purpose of this website is two-fold: One, to showcase my work and writings. Two, to develop some front-end development skills.
